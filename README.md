This project integrates financial time series forecasting, deep learning, and economic modeling to simulate and optimize tax policy using real-world market data. It begins by fetching monthly financial data (e.g., from the S\&P 500) via the `yfinance` API and preprocessing it to simulate GDP values. The project applies an ARIMA model for traditional time series forecasting and an LSTM neural network to capture complex temporal dependencies, comparing both approaches through accuracy metrics and visualizations. It further incorporates a game theory-based optimization model to simulate taxpayer behavior and maximize government revenue based on tax rates and compliance. Additionally, it employs a simple reinforcement learning loop to identify the best dynamic tax rate. This interdisciplinary project blends econometrics, machine learning, and public policy strategy to explore data-driven decision-making.
